WebkitFLTK is a port of Webkit to FLTK 1.3.

As it's intended for use in the Fifth browser, some of the HTML functionality
has corresponding changes.

It very likely won't be upstreamed, as the Webkit community has (rightfully)
some strict requirements for ports that we can't fill (3 full-time people, etc.).

Dependencies
------------

WebkitFLTK requires cairo, harfbuzz, libxslt, sqlite, ICU,
and FLTK 1.3.3 or greater. 
FLTK 1.3.2 does not provide set_active()/clear_active(), and
1.3.3 fixes several bugs.
JavaScriptCore needs Perl, Python, and Ruby to build.

Building
--------

You can try to build using the upstream Webkit cmake scripts, or the hacked-up
plain makefiles included herein.

The cmake system did not work for us, which is the reason for the makefiles.

----
make -C Source/WTF/wtf
make -C Source/JavaScriptCore gen
make -C Source/JavaScriptCore
make -C Source/WebCore
make -C Source/WebKit/fltk

# Optionally
make -C Source/WebKit/fltk install
----

Notes
-----

GCC 4.7.3 minimum. 4.7 series is in theory enough, but .0-.2 had a C++11 bug.
4.8.3 tested.
